After you completed the SW Carpentry training on git, this is probably an accurate description of your workflow ([source: xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1597/)):

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/fig/git_xkcd.png"/>

This module introduces you to intermediate and advanced concepts, starting with the concept of *branches*.
You will also learn how to undo things and juggle commits and changes.
For this, we mostly rely on the interactive website [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/),
but provide some gapfillers and further reading material in the future.
